## Goal  
Analyze a dataset of AI job listings to uncover salary trends and skill demands in the global AI job market for 2025.

## Dataset  
- **Title:** Global AI Job Dataset  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Size:** 15,000 rows Ã— 19 columns
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `job_id`, `job_title`, `salary_usd`, `salary_currency`  
  - `experience_level`, `employment_type`, `company_location`, `company_size`  
  - `employee_residence`, `remote_ratio`, `required_skills`, `education_required`  
  - `years_experience`, `industry`, `posting_date`, `application_deadline`  
  - `job_description_length`, `benefits_score`, `company_name`

## Methods  
- Cleaned the dataset by removing rows with "Israel" in `company_location` or `employee_residence`  
- Categorized job titles into groups like Engineering, Science, and Consulting  
- Performed grouping and aggregation to analyze:  
  - Average salary by experience level, employment type, and industry  
  - Number of jobs by category, industry, and company  
  - Fully remote jobs and their average salary  
  - Jobs requiring specific skills like Python

## Key Insights
