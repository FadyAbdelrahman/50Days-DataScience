## Goal  
Explore and analyze 10 years of daily exchange rates to uncover patterns in currency trends, volatility, and regional economic impacts using Python and visual analytics.

## Dataset  
- **Title:** Daily Updated Exchange Rates (2015â€“2025)  
- **Source:** [Provide source if available]  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Size:** 3,897 rows Ã— 54 columns  
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `date`  
  - `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`, `CHF`, `CAD`, `AUD`, `CNY`, `INR`, `RUB`, etc.  

## Methods  
- Cleaned missing values using forward-fill techniques  
- Ensured `date` column is in datetime format for time-based analysis  
- Created visual comparisons across currencies and time periods  
- Performed the following analyses:

### ðŸ“Š General Analysis  
- Year-over-year trends in exchange rates for major currencies  
- Top 10 currencies with the highest volatility in 2023  
- Currencies with the lowest volatility in 2023  
- Average exchange rates by region (e.g., Asia, Europe, Americas)  
- Ranking by currency stability and fluctuation  
- Exchange rate distribution in 2023 and 2025  
- Currency-level trajectories (e.g., USD, EUR, JPY)

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Analysis  
- Correlation heatmap among major currencies  
- Comparative trends between USD and other currencies (e.g., GBP, JPY)  
- Regional economic shifts reflected in currency values (e.g., Asia-Pacific, Europe)  
- Cluster analysis by currency similarity  
- Forecasting future exchange rates using regression models

## Key Insights  
- **Venezuelan BolÃ­var (VES)** and **Iranian Rial (IRR)** experienced the highest volatility  
- **Currency Volatility** is more pronounced in emerging markets  
- **Europe's currencies** (e.g., EUR, GBP) show relative stability  
- **Asia's currencies** (e.g., CNY, INR) exhibit moderate growth with occasional fluctuations  
- **USD strength** has increased, particularly against emerging market currencies  
- **Regional events** (e.g., economic policies, geopolitical tensions) significantly impact exchange rates  

## Output  
- Visualizations (matplotlib/seaborn):  
  - Line plots for currency trends over time  
  - Bar charts for volatility rankings  
  - Heatmaps for monthly average exchange rates  
  - Comparative graphs by currency and region
