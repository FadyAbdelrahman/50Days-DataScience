## Goal  
Analyze global electricity production trends from 2010 to 2022, focusing on energy sources, renewables, and regional contributions to understand the evolving landscape of electricity generation.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: data.csv (Monthly Electricity Production in GWh [2010-2022])  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Columns**:  
  - `COUNTRY`  
  - `CODE_TIME`  
  - `TIME`  
  - `YEAR`  
  - `MONTH`  
  - `MONTH_NAME`  
  - `PRODUCT`  
  - `VALUE`  
  - `DISPLAY_ORDER`  
  - `yearToDate`  
  - `share`  

## Methods  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Checked for missing values; `yearToDate` had 17,105 missing entries.  
  - Mapped countries to continents using a custom dictionary for regional analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Grouped data by country, year, month, and energy source.  
  - Calculated total production, renewable shares, and production volatility.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Line plot: Total electricity production by year.  
  - Bar chart: Top energy sources by total production.  
  - Pie chart: Renewables vs. non-renewables.  
  - Bar chart: Average monthly electricity production.  
  - Bar chart: Production volatility by country.  

## Key Insights  
- **Top Producers**: OECD Total leads with over 924 million GWh, followed by IEA Total and OECD Americas.  
- **Energy Sources**: Non-renewables like coal and natural gas dominate, but renewables like hydro, wind, and solar are on the rise.  
- **Renewables Share**: Europe leads in renewable energy share, while Asia has the highest total production.  
- **Seasonal Trends**: Production peaks in winter months like January and December.  

## Output  
- Visualizations saved for:  
  - Total Electricity Production by Year  
  - Top Energy Sources by Total Production  
  - Renewables vs. Non-Renewables  
  - Average Monthly Electricity Production  
  - Production Volatility by Country
