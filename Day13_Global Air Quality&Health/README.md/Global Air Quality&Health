## Goal  
Investigate air quality trends and their effects on respiratory health using a global dataset, identifying key patterns and correlations.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: air_quality_health_dataset.csv  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Columns**:  
  - `city`  
  - `date`  
  - `aqi`  
  - `pm2_5`  
  - `pm10`  
  - `no2`  
  - `o3`  
  - `temperature`  
  - `humidity`  
  - `hospital_admissions`  
  - `population_density`  
  - `hospital_capacity`  

## Methods  
- **Data Cleaning**: Converted `date` to datetime, verified no missing values.  
- **Analysis**: Grouped data by city, year, and population density; calculated averages and correlations.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Line plot: AQI over time (London).  
  - Scatter plot: PM2.5 vs. hospital admissions.  
  - Boxplot: AQI by population density.  
  - Heatmap: Pollutants by city and correlations.  
  - Bar chart: Hazardous AQI days.  
  - Histogram: PM10 distribution.  

## Key Insights  
- **Severe Pollution**: Delhi has 10,492 days with AQI > 300, far ahead of Beijing (6,725).  
- **Health Impact**: Weak positive correlation between PM2.5 and hospital admissions.  
- **Rural AQI**: Higher average AQI in rural areas (252.39) than urban (249.05).  
- **Temporal Trends**: Lower AQI on weekends; annual AQI fluctuates without a clear trend.  

## Output  
- Visualizations saved for trends, correlations, and distributions.
