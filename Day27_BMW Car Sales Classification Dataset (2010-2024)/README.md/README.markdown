## Goal  
Explore and analyze BMW car sales data from 2010 to 2024 to understand sales trends, regional differences, and the impact of various features on sales classification.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** BMW Car Sales Classification Dataset (2010-2024)  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Features:**  
  - Model  
  - Year

  - Fuel_Type  
  - Transmission  
  - Engine_Size_L  
  - Mileage_KM  
  - Price_USD  
  - Sales_Volume  
  - Sales_Classification  

## Methods  
- Cleaned data by:  
  - Checking for missing values.  
  - Standardizing column names.  
- Enriched data by:  
  - Grouping by model, region, and other categories.  
- Visualizations:  
  - Pie chart: Distribution of fuel types.  
  - Bar plot: Number of cars by model year range.  
  - Line plot: Average price by year.  
  - Heatmap: Price vs. mileage.  

## Key Insights

## Next Steps  
- Time series forecasting for future sales trends.  
- Build interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit / Plotly Dash) to explore patterns dynamically.
