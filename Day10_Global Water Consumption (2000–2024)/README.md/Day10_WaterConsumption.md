## 🎯 Goal  
Analyze global water consumption patterns from 2000 to 2024 across different dimensions:
- Countries
- Per capita vs total consumption
- Sectoral usage (agricultural, industrial, household)
- Rainfall impact & groundwater depletion
- Identify trends, correlations & anomalies
- Visual storytelling using EDA & visualizations

## 📁 Dataset  
- **Name:** Global Water Consumption Dataset  
- **Years Covered:** 2000–2024  
- **Features:**
  - `Country`, `Year`
  - `Total Water Consumption (Billion Cubic Meters)`
  - `Per Capita Water Use (Liters per Day)`
  - `Agricultural / Industrial / Household Water Use (%)`
  - `Rainfall Impact (mm)`, `Groundwater Depletion Rate (%)`
  - `Water Scarcity Level`

---

## 🛠️ Methods  
- **Data Inspection**
  - Checked missing values, data types, and basic stats
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Identified top consumers in total & per capita terms
  - Assessed annual trends and rainfall correlations
- **Visualizations**
  - Line plots, bar charts, pairplots, pie charts
  - Sectoral breakdowns and geographic comparisons
- **Multivariate Analysis**
  - Used `pairplot` and correlation matrix to detect patterns

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **China, UK, and Brazil** top the list in per capita water use (2023).
- **Germany and France** show highest **groundwater depletion** rates in 2024.
- **Agricultural sector** consistently consumes ~50%+ of global water resources.
- **Rainfall shows minimal correlation** with total consumption (r ≈ -0.02).
- **USA, China, and India** dominate in total water volume consumed.
- A noticeable **dip in agricultural usage** was observed in specific years (2003, 2015).

## 📊 Visuals Included  
- Annual Trend of Per Capita Water Use (2000–2024)  
- Avg. Agricultural Water Use by Year  
- Avg. Industrial Water Use by Country  
- Top Countries by Groundwater Depletion (2024)  
- Pairplot for multivariate pattern detection  
- Water Use by Sector (Agriculture vs Industry vs Household)  
- Total Water Consumption Trends by Top Countries  


## 🏁 Output Files  
- `clean_water_data.csv`  
- Visuals (`.png`) for each analysis step  
- `output/Untitled.html` – detailed notebook export
