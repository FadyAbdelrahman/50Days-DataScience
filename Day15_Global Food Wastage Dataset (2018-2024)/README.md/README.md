## Goal  
Analyze global food wastage from 2018 to 2024 to understand trends in food waste, economic losses, and per capita waste across countries and food categories.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: global_food_wastage_dataset.csv  
- **Format**: CSV  
- **Columns**:  
  - `Country`  
  - `Year`  
  - `Food Category`  
  - `Total Waste (Tons)`  
  - `Economic Loss (Million $)`  
  - `Avg Waste per Capita (Kg)`  
  - `Population (Million)`  
  - `Household Waste (%)`  

## Methods  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Verified no missing values in the dataset.  
  - Calculated derived metrics like household waste in tons and per capita economic losses.  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Grouped data by country, year, and food category.  
  - Calculated totals, averages, and percentages for waste and economic losses.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Pie chart: Top 3 countries by food waste in 2024.  
  - Bar chart: Total waste by food category.  
  - Line plot: Global food waste trend (2018-2024).  
  - Line plot: Economic loss trend (2018-2024).  
  - Heatmap: Waste by country and year.  

## Key Insights
