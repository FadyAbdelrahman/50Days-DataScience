## Goal  
Analyze a dataset of clothing store sales to uncover trends in sales performance, payment methods, product categories, and shopping patterns using Python and data visualization techniques.

## Dataset  
- **Title:** Clothing Sales Dataset  
- **Source:** Custom dataset (Clothing_Store_Sales_Data.csv)  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Size:** 10,000 rows Ã— 9 columns  
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `InvoiceNo`, `Store`, `ItemCategory`  
  - `Price`, `Quantity`, `TotalAmount`  
  - `Date`, `PaymentMethod`

## Methods  
- Cleaned data by verifying no missing values and converting `Date` to datetime format  
- Grouped data by store, product category, and date for aggregation  
- Created visualizations to explore sales trends and relationships  
- Performed the following analyses:

### ðŸ“Š General Analysis  
- Total sales and quantity sold by store  
- Distribution of payment methods  
- Top-selling product categories by total sales  
- Sales trends by day of the week  
- Top invoices by quantity sold  

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Analysis  
- Heatmap of price vs. quantity impact on total sales  
- Average price and total amount by product category  
- Percentage distribution of payment methods  
- Sales aggregation by date and store  

## Key Insights  
- **Top Stores:** Store A leads with $893,812.07 in sales, followed by Store B ($884,349.56) and Store C ($880,232.57).
