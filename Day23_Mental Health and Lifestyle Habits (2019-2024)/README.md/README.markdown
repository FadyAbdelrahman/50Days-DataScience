## Goal  
Explore and analyze mental health and lifestyle habits data from 2019 to 2024 to uncover patterns related to exercise, diet, sleep, and their impact on mental well-being using Python and visual analytics.

## Dataset  
- **Title:** Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits (2019-2024)  
- **Source:** [Provide source if available]  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Size:** 3,000 rows Ã— 12 columns  
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `Country`, `Age`, `Gender`  
  - `Exercise Level`, `Diet Type`, `Sleep Hours`  
  - `Stress Level`, `Mental Health Condition`  
  - `Work Hours per Week`, `Screen Time per Day (Hours)`  
  - `Social Interaction Score`, `Happiness Score`  

## Methods  
- Cleaned missing values in `Mental Health Condition` using the mode  
- Grouped data by country, exercise level, and diet type for aggregation  
- Created visualizations to explore relationships between variables  
- Performed the following analyses:

### ðŸ“Š General Analysis  
- Average age by country  
- Gender distribution  
- Sleep hours by exercise level  
- Happiness score by stress level  
- Mental health condition prevalence by country  

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Analysis  
- Happiness score trends by age group  
- Stress level distribution by screen time  
- Social interaction score impact on happiness  
- Diet type influence on happiness and stress  

## Key Insights  
- **Stress and Happiness**: High stress correlates with lower happiness (5.44 vs. 5.41 for low stress)  
- **Sleep and Exercise**: High exercise levels linked to slightly more sleep (6.51 hours)  
- **Mental Health**: Anxiety is the most common condition, affecting over 40% in some countries  
- **Diet Patterns**: Junk Food is the most popular diet (21.2%), followed by Balanced (20.8%)  
- **Screen Time**: Canada has the highest average screen time (5.20 hours/day)  

## Output  
- Visualizations (matplotlib/seaborn):  
  - Bar charts for exercise levels and mental health conditions  
  - Pie chart for diet type distribution  
  - Line plot for happiness by age  
  - Heatmap for happiness vs. screen time
