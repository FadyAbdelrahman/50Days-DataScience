## Goal  
Analyze global military firepower rankings for 2025, focusing on defense budgets, active personnel, equipment counts, and natural resource reserves to assess military strength across countries and regions.

## Methods  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Filled missing values in `total_naval_fleet_tonnage_mt` with the mean value.  
  - Corrected typos (e.g., "filina" to "fillna").  
- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Grouped data by region to calculate totals for active personnel, naval fleets, and defense budgets.  
  - Sorted countries by rank, defense budget, and natural resource reserves.  
- **Visualizations**:  
  - Bar chart: Top 10 countries by defense budget.  
  - Bar chart: Top 10 countries by cumulative coal production.  
  - Horizontal bar chart: Total naval vessels by region.  
  - Bar chart: Top 10 countries by proven oil reserves.  
  - Bar chart: Total active personnel by region.  

## Key Insights  
- **Top Rankings:** United States ranks 1 with a power index of 0.0712, followed by Russia (0.0798) and China (0.0821).  
- **Defense Budgets:** USA leads with $895 billion, followed by China ($266.85 billion) and Russia ($126 billion).  
- **Personnel:** China has the highest active personnel (2 million), followed by India (1.45 million).  
- **Resources:** Russia tops proven oil reserves (80 billion barrels), while China leads coal production (4.827 billion cumulative).  
- **Regional Strength:** Asia dominates with 13.35 million active personnel and $575.5 billion in defense spending.  

## Output  
- Visualizations saved for:  
  - Top 10 Countries by Defense Budget  
  - Top 10 Countries by Cumulative Coal Production  
  - Total Naval Vessels by Region  
  - Top 10 Countries by Proven Oil Reserves  
  - Total Active Personnel by Region
