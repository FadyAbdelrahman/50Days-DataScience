## Methods  
- Cleaned data by:  
  - Handling missing values in `Education_Level` by filling with "Unknown".  
  - Ensuring all relevant columns are in numeric format for analysis.  
- Enriched data by:  
  - Grouping data by country, gender, education level, and other demographic factors.  
- Visualizations:  
  - Bar plot: Top countries by average daily screen time.  
  - Pie chart: Distribution of primary device brands.  
  - Line plot: Average screen time vs. age.  
  - Stacked bar chart: Addiction level distribution by country.  

## Key Insights  
- **Top Addicted Countries:** India and Mexico exhibit the highest average daily screen time.  
- **Demographic Trends:** Younger users and males show higher levels of smartphone addiction.  
- **Socioeconomic Influence:** Individuals with higher education levels tend to report lower addiction severity.  
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Severe addiction is linked to reduced sleep duration, and Japan has the highest social media usage.  

## Output  
- Visualizations saved for presentations and social media.  
- CSV files:  
  - `addiction_by_country.csv`: Aggregated addiction metrics by country  
  - `usage_patterns_by_demographics.csv`: Usage statistics by demographic groups  

## Next Steps  
- Develop predictive models to identify factors contributing to addiction levels.  
- Build interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit / Plotly Dash) to explore addiction trends dynamically.
